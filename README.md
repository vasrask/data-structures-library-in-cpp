# Data Structures Library in C++
This project implements a library of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++ and provides a command-driven interface to interact with them.

##  Overview
The program supports the following data structures:
- **MinHeap**
- **MaxHeap**
- **AVL Tree**
- **Graph**
- **Hash Table**

It reads a sequence of commands from `commands.txt`, executes them on the corresponding data structures, and writes results (along with execution times) to `output.txt`.

Modify commands.txt and the rest of the input TXT files.
